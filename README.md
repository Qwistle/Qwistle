Qwistle
=======

The Qwistle is a simple, adaptable, open-source musical instrument design.

Based on the traditional penny whistle, the Qwistle comprises a simple six-hole end blown flute. As any dedicated whistler knows, beneath that apparent simplicity can be found endless scope for tweaking, altering and improving a range of variables, including hole size & position, bore diameter, bore taper profile, lip or windway design, in pursuit of the "perfect" instrument. And of course, there are probably as many definitions of a "perfect" whistle, as there are whistlers to play it!

The files held in this repository provide a starting point, for an open-source & hopefully a genuinely open-designed musical instrument. Before long, it's quite possible that variations in the design will have produced a series of instruments, including whistles in different keys, and with different bore profiles, timbres, responses and so on.

In the meantime, things are still in the "set-up" stage here, so check back soon and see how things develop!
